# **Javascript**

## **Promise**

* Object that is used as a **placeholder** for the **future result** of an **async operation** - **Promise**
  * A lottery ticket can be considered a metaphor for promise i.e. we may get a prize and we may not, a lottery ticket is a "promise" of a prize which may get fulfilled or not (rejected)
* We **NO** longer need to **rely on events** and **callbacks** passed into async functions to handle async results
* Instead of nesting callbacks, we can **chain promises** for a sequence of async operations **escaping callback hell**
* Promises are an **ES6** feature (2016)
