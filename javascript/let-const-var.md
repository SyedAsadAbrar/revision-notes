# **Javascript**

## **```let```, ```const``` and ```var```**

* Variables defined using ```let``` can be reassigned
* Variables defined using ```const``` cannot be reassigned

> When defining variable using ```let```, we may or may not give it an initial value but when defining using ```const``` we HAVE to give it an initial value (since it can't be reassigned later)

### ```var```

* Variables defined can be reassigned
* Should be avoided
* Used before ES6
* It is block-scoped as compared to function-scoped (which ```let``` is)
