# Javascript

## Data types

* ***Primitive*** - Simple
* ***Object*** - Complex

### Primitive data types

* ***Number*** - Floating point numbers, used for decimals and integers e.g. 23 (which is actually 23.0)
* ***String*** - Sequence of characters, used for text
* ***Boolean*** - Logical type, either ```true``` or ```false```
* ***Undefined*** - Value of undefined variable (which is empty)
* ***Null*** - Empty value
* ***Symbol (ES2015)*** - Unique and un-changeable value
* ***BigInt (ES2020)*** - Larger integers (than Number type can hold)

> Javascript has dynamic typing - data types are determined automatically and in javascript, value has type not the variable

<sub>Undefined is also a value and a type i.e. an undefined variable has type ```undefined``` as well.</sub>

<sub>A variable with ```null``` value doesnt follow this behaviour due to a known "bug" in JS which was never correct, it is considered to have type ```object```.</sub>
