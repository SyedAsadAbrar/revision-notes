# **Javascript**

## **Loops**

* To do repetitive tasks
* Used to implement `DRY` - Don't Repeat Yourself

```javascript

console.log(`Lifting weights repetition 1 🏋🏼‍♀️`);
console.log(`Lifting weights repetition 2 🏋🏼‍♀️`);
console.log(`Lifting weights repetition 3 🏋🏼‍♀️`);
console.log(`Lifting weights repetition 4 🏋🏼‍♀️`);
console.log(`Lifting weights repetition 5 🏋🏼‍♀️`);

// or

// for loop keeps running while condition is TRUE
for (let rep = 1; rep <= 5; rep++) {
  console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${rep} 🏋🏼‍♀️`);
}
```
