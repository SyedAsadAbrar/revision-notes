# **Javascript**

## **Statement**

Bigger piece of code which doesn't produce a value on its own e.g.

* `if`/`else` statements

## **Expression**

Piece of code which produces a value e.g.:

* `3 + 4` - produces `7`
* `I am ${2023-1997} years old` - produces `I am 25 years old`

> Javascript expects statements and expressions in different places such as in string literals, an expression is expected
